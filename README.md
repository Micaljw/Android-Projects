RecipeCart App in development

We designed and developed an Android app for Advanced Software Engineering. The app is designed to maintain a database of ingredients which the user has on hand. A search API is used to find recipes that match the user's current ingredients. The app also allows users to maintain a list of favorite recipes. Currently, the user must enter each ingredient manually, but in the future, the app will also use optical character recognition to allow a user to scan a grocery store receipt for new ingredients. Many other features are also possible, including calorie counting, shopping lists, and meal planning.
